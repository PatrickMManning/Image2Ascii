This is a simple command line Java program used to convert images to Ascii.

To use, compile both .java files in the src folder:

  javac Img2Ascii.java
  javac CommandLineImg2AsciiWrapper.java
  
Then run with the following command:

  java CommandLineImg2AsciiWrapper path/to/image.jpg path/to/output.txt

N.B. The output file should be viewed in a monospace font to preserve the spacial relation of pixels in the original image.
